# oscmix

[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~mcf/oscmix/commits/main.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~mcf/oscmix/commits/main)

oscmix implements an OSC API for RME's Fireface UCX II running in
class-compliant mode, allowing full control of the device's
functionality through OSC on POSIX operating systems supporting USB
MIDI.

## Current status

Most things work, but still needs a lot more testing, polish,
cleanup. Some things still need to be hooked up in the UI or
implemented in oscmix.

### Supported devices

- RME Fireface UCX II

## Usage

```
oscmix [-dl] [-r recvaddr] [-s sendaddr]
```

oscmix reads and writes MIDI SysEx messages from/to file descriptors
6 and 7 respectively, which are expected to be opened.

By default, oscmix will listen for OSC messages on `udp!127.0.0.1!7222`
and send to `udp!127.0.0.1!8222`.

See the manual, [oscmix.1], for more information.

## Running

### Linux

On Linux systems, you can use bundled `alsarawio` program open and
configure a given raw MIDI subdevice and set up these file descriptors
appropriately.

To determine your MIDI device, look for it in the output of `amidi -l`
(the one ending in `,1` with the name `Fireface UCX II`).

For example:

```sh
alsarawio 2,0,1 oscmix
```

There is also a tool `alsaseqio` that requires alsa-lib and uses
the sequencer API.

To determine the client and port for your device, find it (port 1
of the Fireface UCX II) in the output of `aconnect -l`.

For example:

```sh
alsaseqio 24:1 oscmix
```

### BSD

On BSD systems, you can launch oscmix with file descriptors 6 and
7 redirected to the appropriate MIDI device.

For example:

```sh
oscmix 6<>/dev/rmidi1 7>&6
```

## GTK UI

The [gtk](gtk) directory contains oscmix-gtk, a GTK frontend that
communicates with oscmix using OSC.

![oscmix-gtk](https://mforney.org/misc/oscmix.png)

To run oscmix-gtk without installing, set the `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR`
environment variable.

```sh
GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR=$PWD/gtk ./gtk/oscmix-gtk
```

## Web UI

The [web](web) directory contains a web frontend that can communicate
with oscmix through OSC over a WebSocket, or by directly to an
instance of oscmix compiled as WebAssembly running directly in the browser.

![oscmix-web]

The web UI is automatically deployed at
[https://michaelforney.github.io/oscmix](https://michaelforney.github.io/oscmix).

It is tested primarily against the chromium stable channel, but
patches to support other/older browsers are welcome (if it doesn't
complicate things too much).

Also included is a UDP-to-WebSocket bridge, `wsdgram`. It expects
file descriptors 0 and 1 to be an open connection to a WebSocket
client. It forwards incoming messages to a UDP address and writes
outgoing messages for any UDP packet received. Use it in combination
with software like [s6-tcpserver] or [s6-tlsserver].

```sh
s6-tcpserver 127.0.0.1 8222 wsdgram
```

To build `oscmix.wasm`, you need `clang` supporting wasm32, `wasm-ld`,
and `wasi-libc`.

## OSC API

The OSC API is not yet final and may change without notice.

| Method | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/input/{1..20}/mute` | `i` enabled | Input *n* muted |
| `/input/{1..20}/fxsend` | `f` db (-65-0) | Input *n* FX send level |
| `/input/{1..20}/stereo` | `i` enabled | Input *n* is stereo |
| `/input/{1..20}/record` | `i` enabled | Input *n* record enabled |
| `/input/{1..20}/playchan` | `i` 0=off 1-60 | Input *n* play channel |
| `/input/{1..20}/msproc` | `i` enabled | Input *n* M/S processing enabled |
| `/input/{1..20}/phase` | `i` enabled | Input *n* phase invert enabled |
| `/input/{1..4}/gain` | `f` 0-75 (n=1,2) 0-24 (n=3,4) | Input *n* gain |
| `/input/{1..2}/48v` | `i` enabled | Input *n* phantom power enabled |
| `/input/{3..8}/reflevel` | `i` 0=+4dBu 1=+13dBu 2=+19dBu | Input *n* reference level |
| `/durec/status` | `i` | DURec status |
| `/refresh` | none | **W** Refresh device registers |
| `/register` | `ii...` register, value | **W** Set device register explicitly |

**TODO** Document rest of API. For now, see the OSC tree in `oscmix.c`.
